    PDF stamper

    The PDF Stamper API enables the possibility to add both static and dynamic stamps on existing PDFs. The stamps can consist of one or more barcode, hyperlink, image, line or text elements.    The flow is generally as follows:  1. Make a configuration containing the stamp information  2. Create a job specifying the desired configuration  3. Add one or more PDF files to the job  4. Start the job for processing  5. Retrieve the processed files    Full API Documentation: https://docs.sphereon.com/api/pdf-stamper/1.0  Interactive testing: A web based test console is available in the Sphereon API Store at https://store.sphereon.com
